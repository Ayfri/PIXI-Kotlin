# PIXI-Kotlin

This is a simple example of what a PIXI transcription in Kotlin could look like.

For now, there are all the classes, interfaces, enums, functions, type aliases, and objects.
Classes with only static members have been changed to Kotlin Objects. 
The private members are not present.

just add this to your dependencies:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.ayfri:PIXI-Kotlin:0.1.0")}
```

For now you have to build the lib locally by running:
```
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```
