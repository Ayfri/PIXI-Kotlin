# PIXI-Kotlin

This is a simple example of what a PIXI transcription in Kotlin could look like.
It's just a demonstration, I do not advise you to use it for now.

I'm searching how to make it run.

For know, there are all the classes, interfaces, enums, functions and objects.
The private members are not present.
