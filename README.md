# PIXI-Kotlin

This is a simple example of what a PIXI transcription in Kotlin could look like.

Use this template to create your own PIXI-Kotlin projects.

For now, there are all the classes, interfaces, enums, functions, type aliases, and objects.
Classes with only static members have been changed to Kotlin Objects. 
The private members are not present.
